|  | keyword | description |   
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | abstract       | Specifies that a class or method will be implemented later, in a subclass 
| 02 | assert         | Assert describes a predicate placed in a java program to indicate that the developer hinks that the predicate is always true at that place.
| 03 | boolean        | A data type that can hold True and False values only 
| 04 | break          | A control statement for breaking out of loops
| 05 | byte           | A data type that can hold 8-bit data values 
| 06 | case           | Used in switch statements to mark blocks of text
| 07 | catch          | Catches exceptions generated by try statements
| 08 | char           | A data type that can hold unsigned 16-bit Unicode characters
| 09 | class          | Declares a new class
| 10 | continue       | Sends control back outside a loop 
| 11 | default        | Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement
| 12 | do             | Starts a do-while loop
| 13 | double         | A data type that can hold 64-bit floating-point numbers
| 14 | else           | Indicates alternative branches in an if statement 
| 15 | enum           | A Java keyword is used to declare an enumerated type. Enumerations extend the base class.
| 16 | extends        | Indicates that a class is derived from another class or interface 
| 17 | final          | Indicates that a variable holds a constant value or that a method will not be overridden
| 18 | finally        | Indicates a block of code in a try-catch structure that will always be executed
| 19 | float          | A data type that holds a 32-bit floating-point number 
| 20 | for            | Used to start a for loop
| 21 | if             | Tests a true/false expression and branches accordingly
| 22 | implements     | Specifies that a class implements an interface 
| 23 | import         | References other classes
| 24 | instanceof     | Indicates whether an object is an instance of a specific class or implements an interface 
| 25 | int            | A data type that can hold a 32-bit signed integer 
| 26 | interface      | Declares an interface
| 27 | long           | A data type that holds a 64-bit integer
| 28 | native         | Specifies that a method is implemented with native (platform-specific) code 
| 29 | new            | Creates new objects
| 30 | package        | Declares a Java package
| 31 | private        | An access specifier indicating that a method or variable may be accessed only in the class it’s declared in
| 32 | protected      | An access specifier indicating that a method or variable may only be accessed in the class it’s declared in (or a subclass of the class it’s declared in or other classes in the same package)
| 33 | public         | An access specifier used for classes, interfaces, methods, and variables indicating that an item is accessible throughout the application (or where the class that defines it is accessible)
| 34 | return         | Sends control and possibly a return value back from a called method 
| 35 | short          | A data type that can hold a 16-bit integer 
| 36 | static         | Indicates that a variable or method is a class method (rather than being limited to one particular object)
| 37 | strictfp       | A Java keyword is used to restrict the precision and rounding of floating-point calculations to ensure portability.
| 38 | super          | Refers to a class’s base class (used in a method or class constructor) 
| 39 | switch         | A statement that executes code based on a test value 
| 40 | synchronized   | Specifies critical sections or methods in multithreaded code
| 41 | this           | Refers to the current object in a method or constructor 
| 42 | throw          | Creates an exception 
| 43 | throws         | Indicates what exceptions may be thrown by a method 
| 44 | transient      | Specifies that a variable is not part of an object’s persistent state
| 45 | try            | Starts a block of code that will be tested for exceptions 
| 46 | void           | Specifies that a method does not have a return value
| 47 | volatile       | This indicates that a variable may change asynchronously
| 48 | while          | Starts a while loop
