|  | keyword | description |   
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | abstract  | Specifies that a class or method will be implemented later, in a subclass 
| 02 | assert    | Assert describes a predicate placed in a java program to indicate that the developer hinks that the predicate is always true at that place.
| 03 | boolean   | A data type that can hold True and False values only 
| 04 | break     | A control statement for breaking out of loops
| 05 | byte      | A data type that can hold 8-bit data values 
| 06 | case      | Used in switch statements to mark blocks of text
| 07 | catch     | Catches exceptions generated by try statements
| 08 | char      | A data type that can hold unsigned 16-bit Unicode characters
| 09 | class     | Declares a new class
| 10 | continue  | Sends control back outside a loop 
| 11 | default   | Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement
| 12 | do        | Starts a do-while loop
| 13 | double    | A data type that can hold 64-bit floating-point numbers
| 14 | else      | Indicates alternative branches in an if statement 
| 15 | enum      | A Java keyword is used to declare an enumerated type. Enumerations extend the base class.
| 16 | extends   | Indicates that a class is derived from another class or interface 
| 17 | final     | Indicates that a variable holds a constant value or that a method will not be overridden
| 18 | finally   | Indicates a block of code in a try-catch structure that will always be executed
| 19 | float     | A data type that holds a 32-bit floating-point number 
| 20 | for       | Used to start a for loop
| 21 | if        | Tests a true/false expression and branches accordingly
| 22 | implements| Specifies that a class implements an interface 
| 23 | import    | References other classes
| 24 | instanceof| Indicates whether an object is an instance of a specific class or implements an interface 
| 25 | int       | A data type that can hold a 32-bit signed integer 
| 26 | interface | Declares an interface
| 27 | long      | A data type that holds a 64-bit integer
| 28 | native    | Specifies that a method is implemented with native (platform-specific) code 
| 29 | new       | Creates new objects 
| 30 | null      | This indicates that a reference does not refer to anything 
| 31 | package   | Declares a Java package
| 32 | private   | An access specifier indicating that a method or variable may be accessed only in the class it’s declared in
| 33 | protected | An access specifier indicating that a method or variable may only be accessed in the class it’s declared in (or a subclass of the class it’s declared in or other classes in the same package)
| 34 | public    | An access specifier used for classes, interfaces, methods, and variables indicating that an item is accessible throughout the application (or where the class that defines it is accessible)
| 35 | return    | Sends control and possibly a return value back from a called method 
| 36 | short     | A data type that can hold a 16-bit integer 
| 37 | static    | Indicates that a variable or method is a class method (rather than being limited to one particular object)
| 38 | strictfp  | A Java keyword is used to restrict the precision and rounding of floating-point calculations to ensure portability.
| 39 | super     | Refers to a class’s base class (used in a method or class constructor) 
| 40 | switch    | A statement that executes code based on a test value 
| 41 | synchroniz| Specifies critical sections or methods in multithreaded code
| 42 | this      | Refers to the current object in a method or constructor 
| 43 | throw     | Creates an exception 
| 44 | throws    | Indicates what exceptions may be thrown by a method 
| 45 | transient | Specifies that a variable is not part of an object’s persistent state
| 46 | try       | Starts a block of code that will be tested for exceptions 
| 47 | void      | Specifies that a method does not have a return value
| 48 | volatile  | This indicates that a variable may change asynchronously
| 49 | while     | Starts a while loop
